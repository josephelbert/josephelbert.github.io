# Penetration Testing Report

## Overview

This is a simulated penetration test conducted against a vulnerable machine/lab environment. The objective was to follow a real-world penetration testing methodology and document all findings, vulnerabilities, and exploitation steps. This project demonstrates my ability to assess systems, identify weaknesses, and communicate findings effectively.

## Objectives

- Perform a full-scope penetration test using professional methodology.
- Identify and exploit vulnerabilities across multiple vectors.
- Document all steps and findings in a formal report.
- Provide risk ratings and actionable mitigation recommendations.

## Methodology
This test followed the industry-standard penetration testing phases:
- Reconnaissance
- Scanning & Enumeration
- Exploitation
- Privilege Escalation
- Post-Exploitation
- Reporting

## Lessons Learned
- Importance of thorough enumeration—each detail can lead to compromise.
- How chained vulnerabilities (e.g., SMB creds → SSH access → SUID escalation) mirror real-world breaches.
- Practical use of CVSS and MITRE ATT&CK in reporting adds professionalism.
