# Cybersecurity Training

I have used many sites to help me learn new concepts and skills in the world of cybersecurity. I strive to stay ahead of the constantly evolving cybersecurity threat landscape. Staying ahead involves actively learning about new threats, vulnerabilities, attack techniques, and adapting my defenses accordingly. This requires a proactive approach to my cybersecurity training, rather than solely reacting to incidents after they occur. I love to gain hands-on experience through online platforms, and I believe this list of sites is perfect for that. They have a large variety challenges, varying from blue team focused, to red team focused, to a combination of both. I love learning!

Some training sites I love:

- Blue Team Labs Online
