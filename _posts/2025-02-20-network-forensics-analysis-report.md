# Network Forensics Analysis Report

## Overview
This lab demonstrates my ability to perform network forensics analysis on packet capture (PCAP) data. I investigated suspicious network activity, identified compromised hosts, recovered malware artifacts, and linked behavior to specific users and machines within a network.

The analysis showcases skills relevant to SOC analysts, incident responders, and blue team operations.

## Objectives
- Analyze a PCAP file to identify malicious activity and unauthorized behavior.
- Extract malware samples and confirm classification using VirusTotal.
- Reconstruct user and machine activity (logins, downloads, browsing behavior).
- Recover network artifacts such as MAC addresses, hostnames, and usernames.
- Practice correlating network events with endpoint compromise.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Network traffic analysis and filtering
- File carving from PCAPs
- Threat identification using VirusTotal
- Kerberos-based user correlation
- MAC/IP/host/user mapping
- Investigative thinking and OSINT referencing
