Hello everyone, my name is Joseph Elbert. I currently live in Augusta, GA. I am want to be a Cybersecurity Analyst or a Cybersecurity Engineer.

I am a cybersecurity student at Augusta University with hands-on experience in penetration testing and computer networking. I am currently learning more about security operations and threat analysis. I use platforms like TryHackMe, Hack The Box, and LetsDefend to hone my red team and blue team skills. On top of that, I have completed a full-scale penetration testing report. I followed industry-standard methodologies such as reconnaissance, enumeration, exploitation, and reporting. I also have a home lab simulated enterprise network with integrated security tools, feel free to reach out to me to learn more about it! Beyond offensive security, I have a growing interest in defensive security operations. I am eager to apply my knowledge in real-world environments, whether it be in a SOC, cyber defense team, or security engineering role.

I am actively seeking opportunities to contribute to and learn from cybersecurity teams that tackle real-world security challenges. I am open to any recommendations for certifications or any other learning platforms to help advance my education. Letâ€™s connect and collaborate!
