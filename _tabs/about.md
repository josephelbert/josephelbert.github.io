Hello everyone, my name is Joseph Elbert. I aspire to be a Cybersecurity Analyst or a Cybersecurity Engineer.

I am a cybersecurity student at Augusta University with hands-on experience in penetration testing and computer networking. I am currently learning more about security operations and threat analysis. I use platforms like Hack the Box, RangeForce, and Blue Team Labs to hone my red team and blue team skills. I have a home lab with a simulated enterprise network with integrated security tools. I am eager to apply my knowledge in real-world environments, whether it be in a SOC, cyber defense team, or security engineering role.

I am actively seeking opportunities to contribute to and learn from cybersecurity teams that tackle real-world security challenges. I am open to any recommendations for certifications or any other learning platforms to help advance my education. Letâ€™s connect and collaborate!
