Hello everyone, my name is Joseph Elbert. I aspire to be a Cybersecurity Analyst or a Cybersecurity Engineer.

I am a cybersecurity student at Augusta University with hands-on experience in a Security Operations Center. I love to be involved with cybersecurity whenever I can. I love to attend meetups, collaborate with peers, and participate in Capture The Flag events. I use platforms like Hack The Box, RangeForce, and Blue Team Labs to hone my red team and blue team skills at home. I also have a home lab with security tools like a SIEM, EDR, XDR, IDS/IPS, and a vulnerability scanner. I have a passion for monitoring networks and keeping data safe and out of the hands of malicious threat actors.

I am actively seeking opportunities to contribute to and learn from cybersecurity teams that tackle real-world security challenges. I am open to any recommendations for certifications or any other learning platforms to help advance my education. Letâ€™s connect and collaborate!
